39,t3_115vox,"So, well. My girlfriend and I are 20, and 22 years old respectively. We decided to follow our dreams of creating a digital marketing/design firm about a year and a half ago. The road has been long and hard, we slept on my father's couch in a trailer for 6 months, a dank basement (on the floor) with people who didn't really want us there for the last 9, sometimes living off ramen as we all have to sometimes.

But here we are, on the advent of our success, and Christopher Columbus messes it up. We have a large check coming in the mail, but we didn't get it today because of the holiday. We are currently staying in a Motel 6 for a week, to scout/establish places to live, as we FINALLY after a year and a half of hard work, destitution, doubt and confidence, and above all courage, enough money to get (and keep) ourselves afloat, and enough clientele to support us through the months. 
We're getting an apartment with the money that's coming in (and of course food), but we had planned on renting a single bed motel room for a week for $259, which would've left us with more than enough for simple groceries. They only had a 2 bed avaliable, for about $290. We only had about $310 in cash at that point, so needless to say that the remainder of the money is gone, and we were reliant on that check coming in today to be able to eat. Christopher Columbus! Note, we have NO where else to stay besides outside, no family, nothing.

We haven't ate a meal in around 30 hours, and while we've gone much, much longer before (box of cheerios and a bag of Ore Ida fries for a week... lol) , we just really don't want to go through the slow agony of starving again, especially when we're so on the cusp of being self reliant.

So I ask if there's any kind soul out there that would bless us with a pizza tonight, with the full intention of us paying you back within the next few days if wanted. We have a LOT of work to do, and not eating for an entire day isn't exactly great on your concentration, especially when dealing with tedious stuff like coding.

SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power. They refuse to work out any kind of payment plan and more or less tell us 'all or nothing' by 6pm tomorrow or we're out of luck. Next, find out the oven mysteriously broke while we were away and can no longer cook anything decent. Found this out after I attempted to cook a frozen pizza and was horrified by the half cooked doughy mess slithering through the oven rack. Don't know where I'm getting the money for the power bill and probably going to have to pick up stakes and move back home... but please reddit, if I can use anything right now it's a random act of pizza.

If someone would hook me up with a pizza now, then once I get my first paycheck I would gladly buy them a pizza, or I could pay it forward to someone else listing a request.

I'd also like to make this interesting. I request that the kind, obviously good looking person who does this for me get me their own personal favorite pizza. There are no pizzas I've tried that I don't like, so don't be afraid I won't enjoy it. I promise I will. Or just troll me with the craziest franken-pizza you can design. I think that would be fun too.

105,t3_ibtwa,"Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Ramen. It's gotten me through some tough times, and it's getting me through them right now. My girlfriend gets off work in 15 minutes and then faces a 3 hour bus ride home from her call center (she has the most inconveniently scheduled layovers on her route...she has to sit at the transit station for an hour either way she does it). I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.

Sorry for that wall of text/sob story. I don't expect anything but I'm not doing anything right now but sitting on my ass waiting for her to get here, so posting this can't hurt.

106,t3_11tb71,"Warning: Sob story. Sorry :-/

For starters, sorry for using a throwaway account, but my situation is beyond embarrassing. Posting on my main won't do any good, I don't have any friends, much less anyone that knows me and likes me enough to help out. I understand if you choose to not help because of this, but I can also do my best to provide any proof you'd like within reason.

To keep it short and sweet, I don't have a place to stay right now. I have 2 degrees, recently graduated, but I did something stupid during my first year of college, and have a misdemeanor on my record that I believe has been preventing me from obtaining employment. I have been trying to save up to get it expunged but recently lost the retail job I did have over some really silly shenanigans (boss with nothing better to do than fire people). I managed to land a job interview this week, and was just notified I made it to round 2 on Monday, for a really decently paying position.

I lived check to check, so as of today I'll be living out of my car for 2-4 weeks until a good friend of mine moves into town, who's going to let me stay with him. Food and money is scarce, no way to make ramen anymore, so it'll probably be the dollar menu for a while. I've got one tank of gas to last me. Could someone toss a papa john's gift card my way? They're all over town... I'd be eternally grateful! I can't post on /r/loans because I don't know when I'll be able to pay back, and no way of preparing food from /r/foodpantry, so I figured this is the only assistance subreddit that could really help, even if only a meal for the weekend. 

Well, that was not so short and sweet. Sorry... again &gt;_&lt;.

My mom is a registered NICU nurse. She works graveyards, 12 hours a shift, 3 nights a week. She worked last night and is working tonight as well. She works incredibly hard for our family.

While she's been asleep today, I've been working on cleaning the house. I'll admit, I'm a bit slacking on this subject and it's usually done by mom. 

I figured, what would be better than waking up to a clean house? How about waking up to a clean house AND dinner?

Unfortunately, I don't have any money. I've been unemployed for 2 months now and must put all of what I have left into my credit card bills.

149,t3_zhzk6,"This is actually the long story short believe it or not, please excuse my terrible grammar its very late, and humans do not have an effective way of communicating how terrible a time my father and I are going through.

I was forced to move in with my father and his second wife, (then my stepmom) I had to withdraw from my college classes mid semester and quit my job. After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.

***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.

I told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.

I have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!

I raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.

I am not a happy person now or before I left there.

I hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.

My son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***

Management at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week. As it is, I barely could afford to pay rent and utilities and get decent food before the cuts... and now, I'm living off of however much ramen I can buy with my paycheck and still keep my bank accounts open, which is not good since my car is still (hopefully) waiting for me to pay off its repair bills.

And to top it all off... I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress, as my regular one is infested with Bedbugs, courtesy of my apartment complex.

175,t3_1cexg7,"Hello amazing do-gooders of Reddit!

I'm 26, and graduating with my B.S. in 31 days. I busted my ass off to get a special grant from the state this year so that I could afford to finish my final year of my undergraduate degree. Each semester this is $2500, and really it just helps me pay rent and utilities. (My mom passed away a year ago, and my father is currently squatting in house in the Appalachians somewhere. I literally have nowhere to go if I can't afford a place to live.)

Well, I am still waiting on the grant money for this semester. My case worker contacted me 10 days ago saying she had just caught something she missed, and I should expect the school to receive payment in ""a few weeks""... And I'm still waiting.

Thankfully I just got a part time job working 12-10 sat &amp; sun. But my first paycheck is largely going to pay my recently increased Comcast bill and my cellphone, which I haven't had on since March 22. My birthday was on March 27, and I didn't get a single present or phone call because I can't pay my phone bill. I am behind on my rent. I've been surviving off of 1-2 packets of ramen a day for the past 3 weeks. 

I could really just use a hug... or an internet hug in the form of a pizza...

And fully plan on pizza-ing someone the second I can afford to.

We're just a day or two away from homelessness (you can PM for more info), and what's worse is that we can't get any help. We've tried, and been turned away. It's sad. When you need help, I mean really need it, you can't get it.


For the past couple of days, we've only had enough food for the kids to eat, so we've gone without. As long as they have what they need, we will be okay. They are what matters most to us, and so, we sacrifice for them. We don't get much sleep for worrying and trying to make enough money just to get by. Between the stress and worry, I'm surprised that we can even hold a thought.


I cry sometimes, a lot actually, and I wonder, if our efforts are in vain. It seems like everything is working against us, no matter how hard we push forward, we just can't stay ahead. It's wearing me down, that's for sure, but I know that our breakthrough is coming. Somehow, and someway, we are going to make it.


It's just so tiring to try, and try, and try, and not get anywhere. And what I've told you here is not the half of it. If anyone can help, I will give you the info (verification) that you need of our situation.


I'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.

I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to. 

My other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me. 

I know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.

I'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.

They told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then.

236,t3_kwlpi,"Hey Reddit,

So my co-worker has been engaged for a while and is moving out to Arizona so she and her fiance can be closer to her fiances daughter. Yesterday she, out of no-where, announces that she is going to get married THIS MORNING. No friends, no family...they just signed a paper at town hall and she even had to come into work after. 

My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.

I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.

Personally, I just started working here and haven't gotten my paycheck yet so I'm broke. Would anyone be able to order a large Margarita for this poor girl?

287,t3_iefba,"I have bad luck. Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you. 

About three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and ""needed"" to move out of her mother's house. 

Unfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for ""extras"" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a ""payment plan"" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. 

Apartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. 

She still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. 

Every word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to ""pay"" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. 

My parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.

My history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.

I have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. 

In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. 

The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. 

Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. 

It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. 

With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. 

By the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3

Afterwards I was glad I had another 2 other jobs to fall back on at school. The next day I went and talked to both teachers about the jobs, both hired me for another semester. The I go to the work study off and it turns out that wasn't the case. I had lost my work study job due to my school's budget being cut.

329,t3_o1gb7,"So lately Reddit, i've been lurking a lot. I've given pizza to Constructor who is a close personal friend whom I talk to often. I've always been a giver... Never one to ask for much of anything.

Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.

The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.

I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.

I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.

On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!

So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.

I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.

462,t3_jf2fg,"I'm just feeling really down right now, and a pizza would help loads. Long story short: I'm a graduate student making not so much a year. Last month, I picked up an abandoned dog in the middle of a parking lot. Wasn't financially prepared to get a dog, she just kind of wandered into my life. Ended up bringing her home, getting her spayed and up to date on shots. Turns out she's heartworm positive, but the love of my life right now. Between vet bills and paying my pet deposit ($400...ugh), I realized today I have $404 in my account to last me until the end of the month, and bills haven't been paid yet. I was sitting there thinking about what I have in my pantry and what kind of meals I can make without grocery shopping for the rest of the month so I can still provide for my dog as well. 

As I was coming home and turning into my neighborhood, a truck ran a stop sign and hit my car. I had to wait 45 minutes out in the sun waiting for the cops to get there/report to get written up. Come home, and to top everything off, my dog had peed on the carpet.

It's my birthday next week, but I'm stressed about finances, school, getting my dog up and healthy, and now on top of it, getting my damned car fixed. 

I've bought pizza before, and never thought I'd be on the asking end, but I can't think of anything right now that would make me feel just a little bit better. I will definitely be re-paying it back in the future. Just for now I'm in a bit of a bind.

466,t3_x9etl,"So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated. Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  
  
Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's ""friend"" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.

Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.

By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!

The landlord is always really lenient with my mother so it's understandable and pretty predictable that this would eventually happen due to how far my mother got behind. I immediately went to the bank, withdrew every dime I had, got a money order and took it to their land lord. 

I did this fully aware that I'd be without and with no regrets. My mother and sister having a roof over their head is far more important then me going a couple days without food. I have a well paying job and I'm rarely home which explains why I have no food in my refrigerator. I help people out whenever I get the chance.

470,t3_ialy9,"Wow this is so amazing! Maybe reddit can help me out? I've been unemployed for three weeks. I applied for unemployment when I was dismissed from my last job at a restaurant. I had been working there for six months since it opened and it changed everything for me. I was on the verge of getting evicted when they hired me and I was able to turn that whole situation around because they took a chance on me. Now I'm more confident that even though I had been fired I immediately went out there to find more work. And even though I haven't been able to find more than a few temporary assignments I'm not discouraged about it.

However I am not living so comfortably. I had been living very much month to month. And I was able to pay June rent I don't have much left for food. Since I had been working at a restaurant I just ate for free there. Now I applied for food stamps in California but am not able to get an interview for benefits until after the 4th of July weekend. I showed up to the office and waited all day only to tell me that I can't do anything until that interview.

I've been paying for my food with change I find around the house. My unemployment check won't come until they do a phone interview on Friday with me. I won't have any money after I pay July's rent.

We've been eating variations on beans and rice, potatoes, and stir fry for the last several weeks and frankly we're both really tired of it.

We both tried donating plasma today (there is a company near our house that pays $20 for a first donation), but she's on lithium so couldn't do so and the phlebotomist informed me that I couldn't give because my veins were too narrow. For the first time in months things are looking up--I have three or four good job leads that could be coming to fruition in the next couple of weeks--and we really were hoping to get some pizza as a change of pace.

My fiancee even says she'd be happy to send a plushy as thanks once we've got the money to ship something out--I'd be happy to provide examples of her work via PM if you're interested.

This isn't one of those posts. Truth be told, I have a crush on a girl that I invited over tonight for a simple pizza/movies/maybe a little football evening. While I don't have any cash, I thought I had a credit card handy to cover it, and tonight was the only night she'd be available for another week (student/job), but she's ""really excited we could work this out tonight."" So was I, until I realized the credit card expired at the end of August and I hadn't gotten my new card yet; likely shipped to my old address in Brooklyn. So on top of no food for the ""date"" (I'd like to think, also, no groceries due to the no money thing, paycheck doesn't come for a few days) I have no credit card as backup. No purchases for a few days it seems.
I know that most people will read this and laugh at the mishaps of a hapless kid trying to chase a cute girl with poor planning, but I'm hoping that one person will relate to the irrational, and sometimes stupidly blind decisions we make when a pretty girl is excited to spend time with us. She loves chicken and pineapple pizza and I was hoping to come through with a simple surprise to make her smile off the bat.

I'm a sophomore at Yale University, and I've got a long week ahead of me - I've got a fundraiser to run in New York City, I'm going to be without my laptop for a week while it is being serviced, and classes are actually making us do work now.  I could go on and on about my firstworldproblems, but I think you get the picture. 

What I'm asking for tonight is what I think will be a fair exchange.  

1) YOU
... provide the food. New Haven is arguably the pizza capitol of the world (I can hear the hisses already), and so there's plenty of pizza places out there we can set this up for, however...
There is also a really awesome website called OneButtonWenzel.com that allows you to a press a single button and order the ultimate buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's cheap, its easy, it supports a business - a great deal for you.

2) I...
Will do my best to give you a fair shake. I'm not going to make some sort of pitch that you're helping a dying college student over here - we do have a meal plan and everything, so I want to give you something of substance.  I will photograph the consumption of your order, while confirming as many Ivy League/Yale stereotypes as possible.  
AS A BONUS
If you order two (2) WENZELS, my whole SUITE will get in on the action! That's right, you'll have a pictures of a room full of WASPY New England folks enjoying the delicious late night meal you have provided.

Offers like this don't come around every day - now is the time for food.  I hope you'll join me in this venture.


EDIT: Zombica has been kind enough to provide us with food, and so we'll do our part to provide the pictures while we are waiting for it to arrive. Delivery here is totally random, so it could be until 2:00am before they deliver - if that's the case, it is a risk we are willing to take.

The windshield was cracked, a bunch of the paneling was destroyed, one of the front headlights was cracked and the airbags messed a bunch of things up.

Here's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.

In addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.

667,t3_qc5o5,"Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to say I live in Minnesota, USA.

Hey everyone, I'd really enjoy a full stomach tonight, my future is looking extremely down, but I have the next four days to enjoy, I'll share my story, it's a little lengthy, but you certainly deserve to know why I'm asking for a meal tonight.

The sparknotes version is that my Dad passed away when I was young, too young to really remember anything about him other then he loved Star Trek. After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.

Anyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.

About a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.

I started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there. 

Currently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.

My phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.

If someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful.

I lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday. I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole. 

Fast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops. 

Normally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit.

767,t3_1nuvzh,"Honestly, it's almost comical at this point looking at this past week. The amazingness started off with school. I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/izeow/iama_man_who_has_lived_in_the_woods_in_a_tent/

Wasn't really looking for handouts or whatever when I posted that, still not really - this subreddit popped up in the sidebar.

I used to do a lot of work in SecondLife, and often I would get people to pay me in pizza.  When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.

Anyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.

I've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.

This is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.

I live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.

I was supposed to start on the 3rd but was told I couldn't until I sorted out my work reference.

The money: We've got a negative bank account, my wife is due two payments from her company (she's a freelancer for a subsidiary of Penguin Books), and both of our parents have already helped us financially. We've got a 2nd account with about 30 bucks in it to last us until Tuesday.

All we has with us was a skillit, some vegetable oil, and some celebratory Goya Empanadas. Hey, we are college students, eating healthy isn't our forte. 


I put the oil on and asked him to keep an eye on it for me while I ran to the car to look for something. As I was doing that, he got an important phone call from work and forgot about the oil. I came in and the moment i shut the front door the oil spouted into a pillar of flame. Having nothing with us but the clothes on our backs, we had nothing to put out this oil fire with. 


Instead of letting our new home burn my boyfriend decided to bravely pick up the flaming skillit and take it outside. When the front door opened the flames rushed up and licked over his head giving him a few minor burns. This caused him to jerk away and made the burning oil spill all over his right hand.


He had to be skin grafted from his fingertips to his elbows. He has had to wear pressure garments since the burns healed. It is a tight, itchy, and generally uncomfortable skin tight glove and sleeve that has bothered him everyday since. But he just smiles and endures.

I was going to go grocery shopping when I got off work tonight, but when I went out to my car this morning, I had a flat tire with some sort of nail/spike sticking out of the side.  I had to buy a new tire so I can get back and forth to work.

Friday, I got paid $112, giving me a total of just under $120 in my account.  The tire and labor came out to a little over $118, leaving me 82 cents in my account to last until Friday (payday).  So I wasn't able to buy groceries tonight.  

In the fridge, we have half a pack of american cheese, a head of lettuce, and soy milk.  In the cabinet, we have a pack of ramen, three slices of bread, and some chocolate syrup.  We live week to week, and we have a grocery budget, and we plan out a weekly menu, buying just what we need for that week's meals.

I'm not going to pretend I've been on Reddit forever.  I created this account 8 months ago, but I never post.  I just come in once in a while to look at the funny stuff.  Tonight, I read an ABC news article about ROAP, and figured it was worth a shot.  If anyone is willing to help me out, we can survive on pizza for two days easily.    It's just my fiancee and myself.  

I'm posting links to a screenshot of my bank balance, a photo of the tire receipt, and my latest paystub.

One redditor was willing to donate a very generous $150, but it won't be transfered to my bank via Paypal until Friday or Monday. Our pets have food for the moment, but their humans are very hungry! Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.

If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;).

I know it's a long shot, but I thought I'd try RAoP. It would be really awesome if they could come home from work to a couple of pizzas. I don't know if it's in bad taste to ask for more than one, but we're three guys and one would just not be enough.

* I really like Doctor Who, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, etc. (you know, all the good shows :] )

[A picture of my windshield](http://i.imgur.com/TjMr1ml.jpg)

So anyway, I call a local glass shop to get my window fixed and they say they can do it the next day while I'm at work.  The next day happens and I am getting ready to leave work and my windshield is still broken.  Because they couldn't keep to their schedule, I decided to cancel with them and call a separate place.  They come and fix it the next day and were super professional about the entire thing.  However, when they replaced the windshield they took my parking permit for my apartment complex with the old windshield.

I just moved back to Bloomington after spending the last year taking care of my mother who was suffering from brain cancer. Sadly, she passed away last month, but thankfully is no longer suffering. 

I've been back for about 3 weeks and have been having a very hard time finding work. I assume because it is a college town and during the summer many businesses are cutting staff and hours till the students come back in the fall.

I am working hard to get my life back in order after the loss of my mother and would appreciate from the bottom of my heart if someone was willing to donate a pizza for me to have tonight. My income has been extremely limited since helping to pay for funeral cost, my apartment's deposit and first month of rent, and bills, so any food is a blessing.

I'm a college student at UNC, and I quit my job in February to try and start a business (I'm a business major). Things are moving much slower than I expected, but nobody said it would be easy. I think I have a chance to make some money this coming week, but until then this is what I'm stuck with.

Well once school runs out and the loans are dry here I am, pretty fucked. Dad's helping with rent and bills each month, but I'm ashamed as it is to take money from him, I can't possibly ask for more until he offers it, especially since he tells me they've cut his pay at his current position.

My roommate has been out of town too, and she owes me $50 for her half of the electric, but won't be back in town until Tuesday. Meanwhile, I sit here in the apartment working, trying not to leave lest I spend money or gas, with a near empty kitchen. And I've just run out of bud too. . .

So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, ""Today I'm going to try heroin.""

It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?

Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.

So yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.

1492,t3_1ifyzz,"Hey reddit,

My husband and I have been kicked off of food stamps for a few days because of paperwork not going through. We're getting that fixed, but money is super tight, and my parents showed up today to help finish the tiling in my grandma's bathroom. The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?

They really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic. 

If you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that. 

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Ok, grandma messed up and mom and dad left. Hubby and I wouldn't mind a pizza if someone wants to give one though.

Welp, tonight I am dinnerless.  I work in video production under freelance contracts, and my client said he cannot pay me on time like he was supposed to.  Unfortunately, that means no dinner for me tonight.  Just wondering if anyone can help a first time pizza requester out.  If I do find a kind person around these parts, I will definitely be giving back the second I get paid, not to try to make that any leverage, but this seems like an amazing idea that I would love to support for the future.

I just sat down to eat a bowl of noodles.  As I said my grace and waited for the food to cool down, I was overwhelmed by a million thoughts.  I just wanted to share them and maybe let someone know they're not alone.

Last week I ""celebrated"" one year of being unemployed.  Ironically it coincided with 6 months of being officially divorced, though the marriage was over long before that.  Today marks two weeks since I scrounged around the house to find every penny and spent them all to cover the bills.  For 2 weeks I've tried to get by without any money.  I've restricted my use of the car to only places I absolutely had to go.  I haven't been to the grocery store in God knows how long.  The first week wasn't awful.  I didn't have much in terms of food around the house, but it forced me to be creative.  This second week has been much less enjoyable.  Some cereal, some pasta, a little of this, and less of that.  You don't realize how long two weeks is until you find yourself counting down every day.  I am hoping to get some relief in terms of an unemployment check on Wednesday.  What I was told though is it could be delayed because I have to re-qualify after one year.  What a proud moment for me.  I've run into issues before, and it doesn't matter that it's not your fault, they usually can't get the money to you until the following Monday.  We'll see how that goes.  I've had Wednesday circled on the calendar in my head as this all magical day.  Realistically most of the money is already spoken for in upcoming bills, but I'll have a little bit of money for grocery shopping.  Right now, and I realize this is a gross combination, I'm craving a glass of milk, and a hamburger :)  

Anyway, the short story is that life sucks right now and I was kind of getting down.  Actually I was really in a bad place.  And as I said a blessing over the ""meal"", I realized that there are millions of people that would gladly step into my shoes.  That my life may seem rough right now, but that's more of a testament to how far I had risen, than to how far I've fallen.  

I just want to say thank you to all of you on here that are helping people.  It's an honorable calling.  And to all of you that truly need help, just know that it will get better.  I firmly believe that we will never be given more than we can handle, and we're never in it alone.  I know how sad and depressing life can be, but I also know how you don't have to look far to find someone who needs help more than ourselves.  

I guess I just wanted to say hang in there.  To everyone.  Keep fighting.  Don't give up.  If you're having a bad day, if you want to rant and rave or scream and cry, send me a message.  If you got that job interview you've been praying for, let me know.  I want to hear the bad.  I want to share in the good.  I have tried to weather the storm alone, and it doesn't work.  I don't need someone to carry me, but it sure is nice to have someone to lean on.

So, here's my story. I've been browsing reddit for quite awhile, not posting much, but constantly upvoting cool or funny stories. TIL that there's a subreddit for people to pay forward pizza. So, here we are. For the past two paychecks, I've been dead broke, paying bills. I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean. For the past week they've been cooking delicious meals filled with juicy chicken and scrumptious ground beef. So... I would feel kind of bad just making ramen for them. So, two pizzas would go a long way. Fortunately, on this upcoming check, I have 5 hours of overtime pay, so I would be more than happy to push back the creditcard bill for a little while to return the favor. The deed doesn't need to be done for another 4-10 hours, I just figured that I would post it now so it could get some time to be noticed. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR. Got 99 problems, but paying back a nice favor ain't one. Or Have ridiculous bills to pay, city is fucking me over with four tickets for two offenses that I corrected weeks ago, and it's my turn to provide food, but all I have left to cook is ramen, and a dollar bill. Getting 5 hours overtime on payday, and can easily return the favor.


That text was copy pasta'd from r/randomactsofpizza, seeing as how I didn't know this was the real one.  More info:  One of my roommates figured out that I posted this, and he's fine with cooking until I get paid, but I would still like to give them a break on cooking for a day, or possibly two if I happen to get 2 pizzas.  Plus, I would really like to pay it forward.  So, it's RAOP's call.  :]  Pizza would be nice, but I suppose not 100% needed.

I finally made it to only having one test a year, and no more nightmarish CAT scans. Today was my first yearly result call. 

You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.

This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama): 

**The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a ""no"" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable. 

**The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries. 

So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here.

1607,t3_ihhbr,"Before I start, allow me to say that I do realize that I am new here. I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.

OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.

A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.

So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, ""hey, your ceiling just fell in on us""

His exact words, were ""I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money""

Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.

But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.

Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.

So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.

We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.

Well the judge's exact words were ""I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts""

The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!

So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........

So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.

So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.

After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...

Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.

The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.

This story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.

Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this.. 

But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...

So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.

Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.

If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome. 

As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)

I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...

So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.

1622,t3_kx1pn,"My girlfriend and I are going through some really hard times financially. Rent is due tomorrow, and we're still two hundred dollars short. There's no food left in the cupboards, and every single cent we own needs to go to rent. 

Times are really hard. I don't think we've ever been this stressed out before, and I don't think I've ever had this many panic attacks. I am unemployed, and despite the hundreds and hundreds of applications I filled out, I remain without an income. She works hard to support us both through these hard times, but I can tell it's really wearing down on her. We went to bed without dinner last night, and I woke up to the sound of her softly sobbing into the pillow.

I don't have much to offer in return, but we can work something out. I'm a writer, maybe you need a report written or something? I own essays. I'm like Will Ferrel in Undeclared.

I need a pizza not only because we need to eat, but because I need to be reminded that we haven't bottomed out, and that things will get better. I'm losing hope, fast.

He got his name because the first night I got him he jumped straight onto a double cheese pizza from papa johns, like in the damn middle and me and my friends were gassed, so this was hilarious, and hence the name Cheesy Basil. He was a righteous little dude, I'm bummed the fuck out and just miss my boy. He had a tumor on his neck and the vet told me last week there was nothing we could do, I live in central VA and it's a struggle to find help for them.
I gotta give a picture of him to you guys, 

http://imgur.com/cpz1Lks 
He always fell asleep in my lap, like, I won't ever have another little guy quite like him. Still, I had him for 6 years, and he and I had some of the best times ever. He loved to sit on my shoulder while I smoked, and I won't have my best little friEnt with me for 4/20? 
It's just going to be a sad night.

Money is really tight at the moment (due to insurance and whatnot ) and a pizza would really help alleviate a bit of that and make me feel allot better.

I have been pizza'd before through a private message and have done the same to someone who seemed depressed and jaded in a unrelated subreddit.
I now have to change my whole life/routine because of the fear off seeing the same bastards again.
They are fairly local and one of them was arrested for the robbery(hence retaliation).
Police couldn't give a **single fuck** anymore as they have someone arrested even though there are still 2 others out there and I'm getting threats.

We resorted to the cabin because we all work at McDonalds and could not afford anything else.  The place needed a lot of work as no one has lived in it for fifteen years prior to us.  Raccoons had torn out most of the dry wall and even got inside the cabin.  Nonetheless we were really excited about the whole rustic feel that the cabin gave off, ...... until it started getting cold.  We have only had a few frost nights so far, but Winter is Coming.  Our Cabin is not exactly ""factory sealed"" and doesn't exactly have a ""heater"".  So as Northern Indiana's harsh winter approaches we are feverishly (literally and figuratively) trying to figure out how to heat our cabin.
