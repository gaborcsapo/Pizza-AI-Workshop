My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.


I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!

It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  

In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.

I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.

[Half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1Gax.jpg)
(I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)

55,55,t3_vlcew,[Request] I need help!I know I'm a loser but I have no where else to turn!,"Dear reddit:

I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.

A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.

The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.
 
I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.

While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.

There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.

See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!

July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? 

I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.

89,89,t3_mx9tf,"[REQUEST] Tucson AZ, USA.  Spent all our grocery money on the vet bill","Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.  He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.


We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.



He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.



If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.




So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.




**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.

I started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. I absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday. 

The pizza wouldn't just be for me. Fortunately I live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her. I would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.

I've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than I, so if it comes down to it, I hope they get help first.

170,170,t3_icsm3,[REQUEST] Pizza for daughter's birthday party.,"Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, ""No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.""  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  

I will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  

My husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  

We are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  
I'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.

She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a ""probability cloud of evil"".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.

If you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.

Here are some photos of Chinadoll: http://imgur.com/a/AMKC6

Basically my story is I was laid off a month and a half ago. I had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews. 

I bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.

I live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry. Could anyone help a guy out?

I'm Riley and I'm requesting pizza for my family.  It'd sure be swell if someone could help us out. We aren't totally starving, but it sure would be a treat.

I'm going to college next year (don't know where yet) so I can get a good job and take care of my family. They deserve it. I pitch it where I can, but most of my money is going to car insurance right now.

Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.

Today after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   

I had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.  

Maybe you see where this is going...  

OM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said ""this is **our** card now, criminal.""  

So that's it.

My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.

Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a ""crazy cat lady"" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)

I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)

Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.

We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids. 
We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.

We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.

Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything.
Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.

Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated.

So my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.

Anyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time.

So about 3 months ago I was fired from my old job. That's normally not a problem here in Germany, but to make a VERY long story short: The government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. I haven't recieved any money in 3 months. So I have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. I'm a freelance voice-actor, but I haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.

However, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. I'm about to lose my apartment and I ran out of food.

I'm not sitting idly by though - I've been sending out CVs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. We'll see how that goes.

So yeah, there's the short version of what happened. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write here, sorry. If you have any question, go ahead and ask.

If anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as I live in Germany. But - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). I can guide you through the ordering process via Skype for example - or I'll write something up.

-However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.

-The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.

-I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.

-From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(

So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).

I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.

Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.

Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.

EDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit.

525,525,t3_hw5vx,[request] Have had a run of bad luck in the last few days... Will return the favor next week...,"So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. 

He took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.

Today I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. 

Also being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. 

TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To ""protect"" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.

My fiancé and I have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now.

I was thinking about a hot meal I can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. Plus, I have a fussy baby on my hands. We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(

I've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)

714,714,t3_yc850,"[Request] Virginia, USA- Lost (low-paying) job yesterday due to the chronic stress fracture in my foot","So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.

I also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.

And then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.

(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) 

My boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.

So, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.

Sorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(

I've been subsisting on tip money for the past couple of days, but I had to quit my job this morning because my manager threatened to fire me if I did not take an 18 hour shift (right after 4 hours of sleep from a 12 hour shift!). I had been working as a cook for a sports bar type place for a week and a half, but I have yet to receive my first paycheck. I quit because I cannot work for a place that does not respect the schedule, forcing me to work unannounced overtime that is often more than the scheduled time itself. I've already filled out applications to 5 places, so I am sure I'll be fine. I'll get my paycheck in the mail on Friday or Saturday, too.

About me: 19, EMS student &amp; highschool grad who no longer has tip money to carry him day to day. I moved back in with my mom from my grandparents house. My grandparents are well-off, but my mother is unemployed and gets food bill from the grandparents. She is visiting my aunt and uncle in Canada this week, so no food bill for me until Sunday. :(

What I can give in return: If I give you my Papa John's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and I will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :D

Well, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. 

Luckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven.

804,804,t3_1kkyau,[request]Long week with our cat Tula-Kansas,"I know sappy stories are sometimes made-up or used to take advantage of people.  I hate to admit it, but this sappy story is true.  Today, my wife and I lost our youngest cat Tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  We rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  The vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.

This week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked ""vacant"".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.

I am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  But Pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.

Thanks for at least reading this.  I will pay it forward sometime soon down the road.

I reside in Walnut, California. We have a local Pizza hut, and there's a Domino's and a Papa Johns just down the street from my place. I'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date. 

This is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)

*Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me. 

*Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM? 

*Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great.

""Hi, I'd really love a pizza and a handful of sedatives. First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.""

A friend responded with this link.
Nothing special about my story, but here goes.
A bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.

What can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing.

The last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.

I'll provide some back story just so that I don't come off as a mooch.
Currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. We're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so I could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until I've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than ""seeing each other"" Sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that I'm actually going to get my shit together.

Today is one of those days where I've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but I've made progress and will continue to strive for progress.
I guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when I've got my shit together I can do the same for someone that was once in my position.

Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?  
My baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  
I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  
I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.  

I don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)

we have food on the table. its usually not much more than boiled chicken and instant potatos but were managing. a pizza dinner would be an incredible treat. even my teen and pre-teen would sit down with us if there was pizza! if anyone can help, id be so happy.

I am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means I've taken vows of voluntary poverty. Teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills. 

So, having recently returned from life on the high seas, I find myself working my arse off to pay the sudden onslaught of bills that I've returned to, which leaves little for food stuffs. I've applied for work at the Seattle Art Museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should I get this job, I won't see positive pay off well into next month. 

Thus, Pizza Gods.. here I am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. Please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - I'll find out if I get that job tomorrow or not.

Sunday afternoon I am driving from NH to Baltimore to see a lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) specialist at John's Hopkins as APS is pretty rare and I have been pretty sick recently and getting worse, not better. 

A friend I actually met through a couch surfer I hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from California to drive me down- he is an incredible person and I owe him my life. He does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure I get the care I need to get well. 

Anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if I can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as I don't have insurance. I can't tell you how blessed I am to have this man in my life. 

Other than gratitude I have nothing to offer him as I am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career. 

Can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either Sunday night when we are due to arrive or Monday for after my appointment? I think he would appreciate it and I know I would more than words could say!

I am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but I can let the giver know the exact details as soon as I know. I am hoping to stay Sunday with a friend from high school in nearby Elkhorn but if not it will be a hotel close to JHMC.

It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.

I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.

Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.

If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song. 

Otherwise, pizza for a song. Savvy?

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.",False,['funny'],776.5553125,Vescillo

Second things second, I do have a reputable **real** account and I will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one. I'm the creator/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/)). It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories.

I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me. Even if you don't plan on helping me.

Finally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.

I would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.

Anyways, I realize that I am rambling, but I'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. I just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons I will explain.

The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.

**So here's the thing:**
I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!

1269,1269,t3_hz7vk,[REQUEST] Sydney student going through rough patch.,"Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.

I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.

It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.

I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to ""pay-it-back"" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).

I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida.

She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**

The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't).

1406,1406,t3_1b3xvv,[REQUEST] Help out a broke student?,"Hey guys,

I've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.

To explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.

I was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. 

My car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.

The reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.

Please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.

Thanks in advance =)

1432,1432,t3_mwbd6,"[REQUEST] Orange County, CA, USA - Budgeting mishap = no food","Long time occasional lurker, first time poster here. I am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby I managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. Due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... I managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum I need to get to work once this week (I work from home mostly as well). 

For the past week I've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that I bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason I acquired a large amount of soda. I ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. At first I was like, ""No big deal, I get paid in a few days"", but that has turned into ""MAYBE IF I USE THESE NAIL CLIPPERS I CAN CARVE A HOLE IN THIS 360 CONTROLLER TO LIVE IN THIS SODA CAN COLLECTION"" mental instability.

Long story short, I have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and I would really like a pizza. In exchange, I'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as I get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.

I prefer Dominos, a medium pizza and a ""build your own breadbowl pasta"" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really I'll take whatever I can get as I'm not exactly in a position to choose.

Heres a link to my outdated blog for some loose type of verification? (I also have one of those verification system code things as well).

About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.

As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.

But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.

I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn

While I was away my girlfriend had her apartment broken into by a lone male and she woke up with him assaulting her luckily she screamed and he was frightened away by her housemate running in, but it could have been a LOT worse. 

she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified. As a backstory, my girlfriend is from my town but is working 3500 miles away in columbus, ohio, until the end of next year, meaning I cant be there to make her feel better  &amp; thanks to my mishaps while abroad, I have no money to do anything about it and no way to talk to her other than landline calling (we've tried skype but it drops constantly - facetime is a dream come true for us but it will be around 20 days til my insurance coughs up for a replacement phone, so its going to be a nightmare until then!)

so basically I'd like some help in cheering up the poor girl. for obvious reasons giving her address out on the internet right now would be a big no-no, but i'm not sure if there is any other way to do it? if there isnt, then can someone from there give me some pointers on an online site i can order for her? i don't mind racking up some over limit fees if it comes to it &amp; last thing I want to do is come across as a scammer.

Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.

As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too.

It's been a while since i've been here, but i kind of really need it. My food plan has run out of money(2 dollars left) and my bank account is less than 10 dollars.

I haven't had a good pizza in a while due to lack of funds, and i really need to keep my energy up for the next week or so.

If we got pizza it would save us as we get so irritable when we're hungry (we all know the feeling)

Please help us!!! We will definitely repay the favour on Sunday! (pizza all round yayay!)

1728,1728,t3_jtbys,[Request] I have been having shit luck... Pizza will help Morale!,"[Request] Out of Saint Louis Missouri. (Specifically The Soulard Area)

So here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..

For the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.
At one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)
Things were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.
Well. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.

She had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.

So here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.
BUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.
So i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.

I can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..
Thanks in advance.

I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P

The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/

I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.

I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?

Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. 


But with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st.

The first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.


i head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday.

It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. 

By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.

Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.

Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.

If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15).

We live a life without credit card debt, and choose to pay with things upfront in our daily lives. We pay our bills, but do not have any spending money. We spend every penny simply on our necessities, so much so that we've only been on two real dates in our 10 months of being a couple.

We have quite the family to feed with two [Guinea](http://i.imgur.com/RIwMP.jpg) [Pigs](http://i.imgur.com/TOBup.jpg) and our beloved [King](http://i.imgur.com/FlkmM.jpg) [Keith](http://i.imgur.com/I3tjM.jpg), and their food took priority this week :/ Will GLADLY repay the tasty favor (to you or another in need) in a few weeks when money gets back on track.  

We're barely 200 pounds put together and a $10 large would feed us for days.

My sister recently has had a string of bad happenings, Both of our grandmothers just died and her Car broke down on the way to the funerals (~500mi)... Its been very tough and we recently went over her financial standing and she averages -120 a month (more if you include her hospital bill that she dosn't pay)-- but Money aside what she needs most is food especially for her daughter(12) and step daughter(17). Thats what she really cares about..

She recently gained full custody of her daughter, the father sat in jail for the first 9 years of his daughter's life.. then upon regaining his freedom sought to take her away to montana, over 2,000 miles away. An ex-con with a new lawyer girlfriend and a seedy past of child abuse with his other offspring.. luckily she won that- but with that came a nice sized loan for her own lawyer

She's been denied by assistance and by the local food bank- she make JUST over the line for too much

Canned Goods, Cereal, Lunch items for school or anything else

I, her younger sister, am a designer (the starving artist) I gave her what i could of my savings to keep her in her apartment, but now i'm reaching out to the Web- She has pizza hut and papa johns by her home or  I can trade work for pizza/favors

I never thought I would be in this position, I usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on Ramen and bread.  Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  

How did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.

I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)

About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.

After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. 

It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. 

By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).

I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. 

For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.

I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.

One day I promise to pay it forward.

1995,1995,t3_iienh,[Request] Power just shut off in Oregon,"Hi, RAOP. So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late).

The power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.

I'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want. 

Full disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves. 

Oh, I should mention--I have a battery backup that's giving us Internet access at the moment. It'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library.

Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and ""one thing just lead to another"" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live.

2020,2020,t3_jhx9e,"[Request] Out of state, and out of money","I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.
I intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.

So I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.
I get there and everything is fine for about a day.
He decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.

The next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. 

I'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. 

I'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.
I don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.
I'm in the eastern PA area. 
Thanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.

TL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.

Normally I'm not one to ask for charity but I *really* need some help this time. I've been working a crappy, minimum wage job for the past year, and I finally got a new position working in a dental office (which is what my degree is actually in, but I haven't found a position until this past week), but I don't start there until mid-June. :( 
My boyfriend, who I live with, got laid off this past March and applied for unemployment benefits shortly after, but of course, nothing has been solidified on that end yet. I'm sure it's to everyone's surprise that the unemployment office isn't super reliable, right?...

So, I am here asking for some kindness to be brought upon us, as these past few months have been particularly trying for us financially. I am also in the process of recovering from a bad car accident a few weeks ago, so I've also had to worry about finding a new car, as well as trying to find a new, cheap apartment since our lease is up in July.

2085,2085,t3_10i6xc,[REQUEST]: Washington State- The move from hell...,"I wish I was making this story up, but unfortunately this has been real life for the last couple of weeks.  My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are ""resealing"" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.

As stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side. While myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit.

It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35AM PST, October 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity. **We remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :).**

Note: We do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will. We believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).

* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.

* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. 

Aside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger.

I do work now, but my total income is far below minimum wage. And I'm just scraping by. A pizza would mean more than most people would guess to me.

It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  I make sure they're fed, but I can never give them anything above and beyond that.  It would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.

2477,2476,t3_14t9hd,[REQUEST] A minor celebration to hopefully the start of something meanginful.,"I won't pretend I would go hungry without this delicious doughy cheesy love, but I do have a story.  I just emptied the little money I had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  I never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  When that came to an end I moved and had no clue what to do.  I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  Like I said, I wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.

We all must face the consequences of our actions, and I want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.  A part of me is scared that I will just fail the whole college thing again, but I know I more mature now, and can accomplish what I want out of life.  Fear is not an excuse to not try.

I'm from Houston, TX.

I've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since I got home.

Me and my Sister were in a car wreck last Thursday. We got T-boned in a parking lot by someone who apparently thought talking on their cell phone was more important than watching the road or applying the breaks... Fortunately it was just her and I in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, I don't think we both would have survived.
We were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.

Anyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. When things get settled out here and I get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.

2505,2504,t3_rpw8f,"[REQUEST] My roommate has had a terrible day, and I'd love to surprise him with pizza.  Details inside","Hello! :)

My roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.

In addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.

I'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.

2548,2547,t3_idoeh,[REQUEST] Date Night / Family Night,"So I'm one of those people brought here by the recent media coverage.  I'm sorry if that makes me an outsider.  I've spent the last few days just reading through this site.  Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.  You laugh at the guy who's just bored and wants someone to send him a pizza, and you feel for the people that a pizza would be more than a pizza.  I've been hesitant to post because while I'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  I finally decided I'd just give it a try.  Worse case scenario, I don't get a pizza.  That's where I am anyway :)

I've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.  

Anyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.

I'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.

I look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.

Thanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.  ",True,[],889.3634259259261,Nirsk

I am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. I had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next Friday. My boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. 

It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me.

It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).

I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.

1.) What's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?

2.) If I press hard enough I might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. What am I?

3.) How many links are in the chain when it clinks?

4.) Right now may not seem like spring at all, but I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.

5.) I had a cat I named him Earl. I had a fish I named him Pearl. But what should I name my bird of prey?

I hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, I'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not I receive a gift card. So best of luck and see how many you can get right. And if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below.

I've always been nervous to post here as I am usually too broke to reciprocate. I'm still broke, but when I get my tax return I definitely will reciprocate.~~

~~A little about me and why I'm posting: I live with my mom and work a minimum wage job in Southern California. (North County)~~

~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. Although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~

~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. It has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and I.~~

~~As of yesterday SDGE came through and shut off our electricity. (I am writing via phone.) The bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (I just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. I know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but I thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~

~~I know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that. Just figured I would give it a shot. If anyone is interested, I can also provide pictures of the SDGE notice on the meter, or whatever else.~~

~~So yeah. That's it. Thanks.~~

Edit: Overdrew the bank account to get the electricity back on, as it was needed for my mom. I downvoted my post, but just struck-out what I wrote so not to just simply delete as this board has advised against that.

I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.

Their financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general.

2661,2660,t3_xg56s,"[REQUEST] London, UK  Extremely poor, tired of butter sandwiches!","Hey there, I am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (£9 to last until the end of August).

I went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).

For years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.

This, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates £100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a £970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only £30 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and £40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her £500).

I've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.

I spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.

Sorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...

But yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha.

I am mid 30's, hub is in his 40's. 

We rely on one another to get things as a team, but the last two days, my knee has been ""out"" and his back has been ""out"" and our grocery trip relies on us walking a half mile to the local Walmart neighborhood grocery store, filling up backpacks and a large rolling suitcase, and walking home with them. 


We have to do our month's shopping all at once because we are on the stamps and to break it up into smaller trips wouldn't allow the money to stretch.


We have an offer for a ride to the store tomorrow, but we've been eating once a day for a week and ran out of food yesterday.

Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.

I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fiancé and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.

My fiancé doesn't get paid until next Friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.

We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.

Thanks for your consideration and time reading this.

My girlfriend, **MuchToTheDutch**, and I both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to Austin. This is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of June and we got paid through the 30th. This basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. We've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next Monday when we get paid.  We haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.

If some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. We'll pay it back two fold come Monday and post a follow up thread that day too.

Since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! Here's my sob story anyway**

I never really did this before so I'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, I probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.

* paying $150 a week, no income, is supposed to include food but no food in the house

* to top it all off I'm still unemployed!

I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. 
That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.

I've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request.

2787,2786,t3_17ytyw,"[Request] Magnolia, Texas. Lost my job and hit by a car while on my motorcycle in the same day. ","So I had a phenomenal day on Friday, I have to tell you all about it. 

I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.

What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.

How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.

Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.

I somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on ""the man"" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.

I drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger. 

The driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.

So now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. I heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give it a shot. Even if I there's no pizza to be had it was nice to tell the story.

I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.

My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the ""world"" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.

I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.

Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.

We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.

I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.

I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.

The high point of my life right now is my little boy.  He's the best thing to come out of my marriage, I would do anything in the world for him.

This is why I'm coming to you Reddit.  My wife is bringing him back tomorrow, and I would love to be able to surprise him with some pizza.  The sad fact is though, I can't afford it.  Which is why I'm coming to you guys.

So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now. 
A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is ""always hiring"" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours. 
According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses.
Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then.
It's just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn't have to cook myself today.",True,"['AskReddit', 'Assistance', 'Favors', 'GirlGamers', 'Parenting', 'Random_Acts_Of_Pizza', 'WTF', 'answers', 'firefly', 'firstworldproblems', 'gaming', 'geek', 'reddit.com']",1083.1691550925923,Nirsk

I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out. 

Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.  Had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because I wasn't made aware I lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it). And Now the car's engine won't even kick over. 

Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )  So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly. 

I promise to pay it forward x2 this pay check (1st of February) and will make sure my benefactor receives confirmation if desired. 

Please and Thank you you magnificent internet type people.

I can't do much in return other than draw a picture or say something or something a 15 year old can do, i can give you a free copy of portal 1 if you want.

Thanks, and i hope this doesn't turn into a flame war or something.

I met a girl awhile ago. We'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it. I just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy.
TL;DR girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and I would like some comfort food right now.

It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!

Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.

I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.

I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.

Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.

So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.

NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)

EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.

 I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

Since I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.

So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that.

3060,3059,t3_ooexu,[REQUEST] Will you be my angel tonight? [seattle],"Dear /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza

I come before you now as a humble man. I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale. 

My name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle. 

SNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work. 

Sadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.

So I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)

I hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.

I've been ""borrowing"" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but I hate having to go to them for anything, so I've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  If you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and DON'T.

The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails.

3109,3108,t3_1jzamt,[Request] Pizza to lift spirits,"I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.

It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again! We've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!

My parents couldn't afford the mortgage anymore, and Bank of America was completely unwilling to work with us in some kind of payment plan; so we're forced to sell and move.

So every six hours he has to attach an IV with ampicillin (some of the strongest anti-biotics you can take) so he's unable to work.  While he was in the hospital for almost three weeks, I was taking care of my siblings, making them dinner (which consists of 4-5 chicken nuggets every day..).

So, I hope that didn't bore you, I didn't get too detailed. As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh.

I have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought ""Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?"" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D

I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. 

Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)

3190,3189,t3_lmy9r,[potential request] pizza for an Aussie ,"Hey RAoP

This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.

First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P
We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P

Sorry but I'm requesting incognito because I don't want anyone I know to find out about what's happening right now. There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.

I got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!

After a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!

I'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.

Sorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude.

7 Weeks ago my dad said his friend was moving in because she needed a place to stay. She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her ""diet"", and baby food.

What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!

Thanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.

TL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.

3434,3433,t3_psmo2,"[request] Northeast Pennsylvania, USA. Hoping to have some pizza tonight.","Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a ""dick""  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.

But alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.

I got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. That's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have I'm a little less than thankful this year.

My mom died last year and I'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.

So yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti.

3459,3458,t3_13deln,[Request] Story of Pizza and Love,"Hello RoaP! I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.


I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""


So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.


So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
So I read just the 1 text. It states:
""Tony better remember what you asked for last week.""
My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget."" 


!!!!! 


JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)


I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.


She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said ""I thought you forgot!"".


She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. ""I will love you until the last pepperoni fades."" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.

---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.

3513,3512,t3_wwdjm,[Request] They just pulled the plug on my grandfather.,"Hey guys, sorry to come in my first time with a really, really depressing post. I was actually introduced to this place a month or so ago and was planning on having my first entry be a 3-pizza giveaway once I got my financial aid in, but I could really use the tiniest bit of support right now.

I just got the news that my grandfather had his ventilator removed and normally I think I'd be fine with dealing with this, but I think it's because I'm by myself in my apartment (my friends all have plans) and most of my family is up in Jersey to say goodbye, I'm having a rough time. As I'm said, I'm new, and don't quite know how to verify this, but heck, I'll take some kind comments at the very least. Seems like a very loving subreddit, so I suppose I'm just looking for a support outlet somewhere.

Anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was ""REDDIT,"" and getting back to my room, the first thing I do is jump onto my computer and go right to RAoP.

My mother was not okay with it. According to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.

My dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'Get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'. 

My Mormon Grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, ""Whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out."" He accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask. 

I think i figured out where i'm staying for the next few years whilst i finally start on my path to feeling better in myself.

does anyone wanna help round off one of my most difficult days ever, and buy me a pizza? It would seriously help me to calm down and take my mind off the massive dilemmas that have happened.

3654,3653,t3_va5vp,[REQUEST] Boyfriend's visiting and had it rough.  Pittsburgh PA,"Hey guys.  This is my first request.  I live in Pittsburgh and my boyfriend's visiting for a week.  I haven't seen him since the beginning of May so I'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.

My boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  

[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]

Now you may be wondering ""What's wrong with the last part"" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.

Anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say ""I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.""  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.

Also, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.

So. We have this fabulous Constitutional Law professor who had to reschedule a few of our classes for I'm not sure what reason... I think she was at a conference, or something.

Anyhow, this means that today our class is, at minimum, 3 hr and 15 minutes long... but she usually runs over time. Because the class is from 10.45 am until 2 pm (it's 11.45 as I post this), this means that we also will be missing all of the club-meeting opportunities for free lunch.

My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends!

Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. 

When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. 

This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts ""What's wrong?"" I tell him ""You, punching me."" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that ""I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!""

I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him ""Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault."" I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left.

We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are ""left"" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes.

i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(Ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)

gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (I find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other)
missed 3 imporant auditions (I am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and Avengers)'

As soon as I get released from the hospital, I get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week

then drove up to CPH (Cleveland Playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (Really big deal in Cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone
on my way there from Parents house, which is  a two hour drive
my car broke down
so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave
so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.

get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated
fucked up that audition
drove home, same 20 mile bullshit
go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, THE WORST PAIN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. Google Kidney stone pain.

While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am ""reliable and stable"", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home. 
Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away. 
then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones
got yelled at again from my boss because I ""should have seen the stone coming and not went to work:
Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys
Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.

And last night, TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, someone broke into my truck.

Lost my job recently and having trouble making ends meet with all of our funds tied up in lawyer and Federal fees for my wife's US citizenship. While I've been blessed with a loving wife and our loyal and hilarious pups, I cannot afford to provide them with anything special during this rough time - even after a humble holiday and stringent budgeting for groceries and supplies from the likes of Aldi and Dollar General. 

Truthfully, I'm ashamed to admit that I've failed so completely in being a good provider for my tiny family and I'm glad we decided to wait on having kids so they don't have to struggle with us. But I also have no illusions about this and I'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. That said, I know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so I'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community I've valued for quite some time now.

My wife is vegetarian, so I would request a cheese pizza. My local Dominos is the cheapest I know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). There are various other coupons as well, from Dominos Store #2878.

Bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in MSPaint!

I have a good, stable job and always have. I've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which I'm about halfway done paying.

I have about $70 in my account (I can also show proof of this) and I need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in Vermont). My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time. 

My fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code.

USA","So, in light of the article that has been floating around here, I feel kind of timid about putting this out there, but I guess I have nothing to lose at this point. In the past, he has searched my reddit history and scolded me for things I posted, etc., but I know that a throwaway won't be acknowledged, so I guess I'll take my chances on him getting mad about this.

I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship for quite some time, and it has been absolutely wrecking my sense of self/sanity.   This weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , ""well, I'm going alone!"" and ""I want you to come with, baby"" moments.  That is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  Last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.

I am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a ""high"" this afternoon. 

I am moving out the first of August, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit/first month's rent. To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.

The icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  Logic tells me I should eat.   Anyone?
