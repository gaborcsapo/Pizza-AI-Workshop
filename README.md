# Pizza AI Workshop
---
## What we are learning today
- Setting up the Anaconda environment
- Intro to Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Building a simple prediction model
- Most importantly that machine learning and AI are not scary!

## Python is great
- No semicolons; simple syntax
- High level language
- Amazing packages

## The Python Data Science Stack
- NumPy: math operations on n-arrays and matrices
- Pandas: data manipulation; DataFrames
- Matplotlib: data visualization
- Scikit-learn: machine learning algorithms

### Setting up
Anaconda: distribution with 250+ data science and machine learning packages
Install for Python 3.6 (not 2.7!)

For Mac OS, open Terminal
`$ python --version`
`$ conda -V`
`$ conda list`

If that didnâ€™t work try these: 
If you have Python 2.7 
`$ conda install python=3.6`
`$ conda create -n py36 python=3.6` 
`$ source activate py36` 
If you have some missing packages 
`$ conda install some-missing-package` 

### Jupyter Notebook
Web app to create a notebook that can run code, display graphs and images
	
To start running Jupyter, type in
`$ jupyter notebook`


### We are ready! Let's open the first tutorial.
